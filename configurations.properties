#Why we use this file?
#to store major test data in key-value pairs.
#How we get data from this file?
#We create a java class to read the file
#fileinutstream, properties object
#we can have multiple properties , but names should be changed
#in test class using Driver.getDriver().get("https://google.com") yazmak hard codeolur
#bunun yerine        Driver.getDriver().get(ConfigReader.getProperty("google_url")); yazarsak dynamic olur
